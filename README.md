# Python E-mail Sender GUI

This is a simple Python application that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to send e-mails. It uses the built-in `smtplib` and `email` libraries for email handling, and `tkinter` for the GUI.


## Installation

No installation is necessary, as it only uses Python's standard libraries. Make sure you have Python installed, this project uses Python 3.


## Usage

You can start the application by running `main.py`:

python main.py
This will open the GUI. Here's how to use it:

In the "Sender's E-mail Address" field, enter the e-mail address you wish to send from.
In the "Sender's Password" field, enter the password for the above e-mail address. Note that if you're using Gmail, you might need to allow less secure apps to use your account for this application.
In the "Recipient's E-mail Address" field, enter the e-mail address you wish to send to.
In the "E-mail Subject" field, enter the subject of your e-mail.
In the "E-mail Content" field, enter the content of your e-mail. This field can accept multiple lines of text.
Click the "Send E-mail" button. You will see a message box confirming that the e-mail was sent successfully.

# Security
Please note that storing sensitive data like passwords in plain text is generally a bad practice. This application is meant to be a simple demonstration and does not implement any form of secure password handling. If you wish to expand on this project, consider implementing more secure methods of handling passwords.
